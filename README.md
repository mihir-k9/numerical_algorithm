# numerical_algorithm
This repo contains a few numerical algorithms I wrote during one of my engineering classes. The files names and associated information is summarised below.

### numerical_integration

1. Pick a function to integrate and define in integral().
2. Pick bounds of integration and specify the exact answer in true_value.
3. Select a range of increments for discrete calculations, specify in delta_x.
4. Modify x_coordinates if needed, to match the delta_x.


### cholesky_dcomp
A method to factorise a squre matrix in Lower and Upper triangle matrices (LU decomposition). This only works for Hermitian, positive definite matrix.
