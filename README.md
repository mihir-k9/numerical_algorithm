# numerical_algorithm
This repo contains a few numerical algorithms I wrote during one of my engineering classes.

### numerical_integral

1. Pick a function to integrate and define in integral().
2. Pick bounds of integration and specify the exact answer in true_value.
3. Select a range of increments for discrete calculations, specify in delta_x.
4. Modify x_coordinates if needed, to match the delta_x.
